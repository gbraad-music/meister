Regroove Meister
================

MIDI Controller Suite for Live/DJ Performance

![](./images/demo.png)


This tool has mostly been created for my own use with Regroove and other applications for Live performance.
It uses WebMIDI to communicate with MIDI controllers and software. I have personally tested it on Android,
like a Samsung Tab, connected to a PC running Regroove, Mixxx, iPads with Korg Gadget/Module and some
physical devices, like a Volca FM, etc.

While this works for me... it might not for you.
